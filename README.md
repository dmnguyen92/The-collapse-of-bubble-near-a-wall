# The-collapse-of-bubble-near-a-wall
The goal of the project is to investigate the dynamics of a laser-induced bubble collapsing near a solid wall. In this work I will first focus on image processing to extract information from the captured videos, then I will move on to constructing and solving a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE) to gain insight about the physics behind the phenomenon
